# BirdsAi
An exploration of deforestation in Brazil. </br> 
This is a personal exploration of using data science and mapbox.js to create a React-Flask app. </br>
I am currently exploring the [Prodes dataset](https://data.globalforestwatch.org/datasets/gfw::prodes-deforestation-in-amazonia/about). </br>

## Installation
At the moment, this is not deployed. <br>
To install the Flask app on your local computer, navigate into the /app-back/app_flask directory. <br>
In this directory, there are two bash script files. 
To verify that python is on your local computer and to install the correct dependencies run these commands: <br>
```bash 
chmod +x install_FLASK.sh 
```
```bash 
./install_FLASK.sh 
```
## Data
In the /Data directory, visualizations from the data explored in the Prodes dataset are provided.
