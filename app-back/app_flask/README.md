## Pyhton Backend
This is where all the backend for data processing can be found. All is hosted in a Flask server. 
<br> <br>
The data being used can be found in the **/Data directory**. 
<br>
In addition to the functioning code, I have also added my test files, as well as a test.txt file which journals the methods that I have attempted and failed. </br>
This serves as a road map to my thought process, from starting with almost no knowledge about using geojson data, trying different approaches, and finding solutions.
